== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. How can I see the GIF once I embed it into my post?
For the time being, you can only see the contents of your embedded GIF by previewing the post itself. We're working on a better solution for later versions so you can see the preview inline!

2. Do I have to attribute credit for any of the GIFs I embed in my post?
No, but it would be really nice of your to mention that you found your great GIF content on www.giphy.com! 

3. Can I use your GIFs for commercial purposes?
Non-commercial use of our content falls under "fair use" and is a-OK! However, commercial use is subject to the copyright of the original content owner.  
We try to have the correct source URL of the gif if possible and commercial use questions should be directed to the original source.  If the GIF is from one our our partners (or GIF artists) we can help obtain rights for commercial use.
